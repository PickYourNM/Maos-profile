  <p>Mao Zedong[a][b] (December 26, 1893 – September 9, 1976), also known as Chairman Mao, was a Chinese communist revolutionary who was the founding father of the People's Republic of China (PRC), which he ruled as the chairman of the Chinese
    Communist Party from the establishment of the PRC in 1949 until his death in 1976. Ideologically a Marxist–Leninist, his theories, military strategies, and political policies are collectively known as Maoism.</p>
  <h3>
    <p>English romanization of name</p>
  </h3>
  <hr>
  During Mao's lifetime, the English-language media universally rendered his name as Mao Tse-tung, using the Wade-Giles system of transliteration for Standard Chinese though with the circumflex accent in the syllable Tsê dropped. Due to its
  recognizability, the spelling was used widely, even by the Foreign Ministry of the PRC after pinyin (Hanyu Pinyin) became the PRC's official romanization system for Mandarin Chinese in 1958; the well-known booklet of Mao's political statements, The
  Little Red Book, was officially entitled Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung in English translations. While the pinyin-derived spelling Mao Zedong is increasingly common, the Wade-Giles-derived spelling Mao Tse-tung continues to be used in modern
  publications to some extent.[10]

      <td>Mao was born on December 26, 1893, in Shaoshan village, Hunan.[11] His father, Mao Yichang, was a formerly impoverished peasant who had become one of the wealthiest farmers in Shaoshan. Growing up in rural Hunan, Mao described his father as
        a stern disciplinarian, who would beat him and his three siblings, the boys Zemin and Zetan, as well as an adopted girl, Zejian.[12] Mao's mother, Wen Qimei, was a devout Buddhist who tried to temper her husband's strict attitude.[13] Mao too
        became a Buddhist, but abandoned this faith in his mid-teenage years.[13] At age 8, Mao was sent to Shaoshan Primary School. Learning the value systems of Confucianism, he later admitted that he did not enjoy the classical Chinese texts
        preaching Confucian morals, instead favouring classic novels like Romance of the Three Kingdoms and Water Margin.[14] At age 13, Mao finished primary education, and his father united him in an arranged marriage to the 17-year-old Luo Yixiu,
        thereby uniting their land-owning families. Mao refused to recognise her as his wife, becoming a fierce critic of arranged marriage and temporarily moving away. Luo was locally disgraced and died in 1910.[15]
